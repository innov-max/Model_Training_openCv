# Computer Vision Training using OpenCV

This repository provides code examples and resources for training computer vision models using OpenCV. Computer vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to understand and interpret visual data, such as images and videos. OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides a wide range of functionalities for image and video processing, feature detection, object recognition, and more.

# Installation

To run the code examples in this repository, you need to have OpenCV installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install OpenCV:

    Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: Python.org

    Install OpenCV: Install the OpenCV library using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

    shell

pip install opencv-python

This command will install the latest stable version of OpenCV.

Additional Packages: Some examples may require additional Python packages, such as NumPy or Matplotlib. If needed, you can install these packages using pip as well.

shell

    pip install numpy matplotlib

With OpenCV installed, you are now ready to get started with computer vision training using OpenCV.
